        "After making their way from the East Coast to Los Angeles, a few straight Bubba cuttings were crossed with a pure Kush plant, resulting in what we now know as Bubba Kush, named after the person who first grew it. The original “straight Bubba” seeds came from Northern California, and was basically an old school Northern Lights strain.",
        "While usually not quite as potent as OG Kush, this cannabis strain is a true Kush classic, and has quite a following. When grown and cured correctly, Bubba Kush has a very specific, somewhat sweet and hashy taste and smell.",
        "Bubba Kush plants grow like true indicas, short, with multiple palm tree like branches with heavy tops. With an average flowering period of 7-9 weeks (or late October outdoors), Bubba plants should yield 700-800 gr / sqm of top shelf buds covered in red hairs and thc crystals.",
        "When smoked, Bubba Kush goes straight to the head, with a mind numbing effect that slowly spreads down to the rest of the body. This smooth, tasty smoke will make you want to take another hit, but overindulgence can lead to couchlock and major munchies.",
        "Considering this strain’s popularity, it is no surprise that it has a few different variations as solid as the original, including Early Bubba Kush, Bubba 76, Pre-98 Bubba, and Purple Bubba."
