        "Based in Holland, the Seedism Seeds collective knows the Amsterdam coffeeshop scene extremely well. Back in 2001, the guys realized that Apple Jack was really taking off, and when one of the parent plants died they thought the end was nigh for the strain. However, breeder Hazemaster brought the collective his technique of “selfing“, or self-pollinating, and Seedism used their Apple Jack cut to bring this great variety back to the seed game.",
        "As pleasant to grow as it is to smoke, Apple Jack flowers quickly for a sativa dominant strain and gives sizeable yields in any environment. Flowering can be finished within 10 weeks, although a week or two more may help to bring out the fantastic flavors in the final smoke.",
        "As a cross between Jack Herer and White Widow, Apple Jack has enough indica genes to make it manageable even in a smaller grow room, although some training and trimming might be necessary. Towards the end of the flowering stage the buds will become very large, so staking your plants earlier will help to control and support them later on.",
        "After curing, the solid nugs will smell a little hashy, but when burning, the very distinctive taste is more fruity than oily. Apple Jack brings a definite trippy stone, during which your body will be too happy to move and the room will revolve around your head at whatever speed it sees fit."
