        "Shiva Skunk shows the excellent vigor of a well-chosen hybrid, making it a snap to grow. Shiva (related to the original Shiva Shanti) was a selected Afghani type that was part of the Sensi Seed gene bank in the 1980s. When the Seed bank and Sensi Seeds merged in 1990, the original Shiva mother was replaced by the top Northern Lights strain – NL 5. The Skunk 18.5 originates from the Skunk #1, but is a backcrossed line. A combination of two power plants, Shiva Skunk retains the sweet pungency of her Skunk parent, but has the higher yield and more profuse resin content of the Northern Lights family. While suitable only for an indoor grow in Holland’s wet weather, this variety may do well outdoors in the more forgiving weather of Spain or California. Most indoor methods will give pleasing results, including a sea of green style garden. Sensi’s Cannabis Castle growers recommend hydroponic methods for a clean and easy growing experience.",
        "Shiva Skunk is a potent, quick indica that has become popular with commercial growers. Very reliable and stable, this indica strain is hardly skunk and very Northern Lights in appearance. As with the original NL 5, you can expect that your plants will not stretch very much but stay short with dense, super resinous indica flowers. You can practically leave your scissors behind when harvesting, the foliage is minimal. Delivering a sweet, fragrant smoke, Shiva Skunk will yield sweet, spicy buds that give a psychedelically stoney buzz. A kaleidoscope and some Shiva Skunk is a recipe for hours or entertainment.",
