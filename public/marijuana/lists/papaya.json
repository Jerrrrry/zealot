        "Papaya is Nirvana’s name for its “mango” strain – an indica-dominated variety with a thick, sweet scent and slightly spicy flavor. While fruity as the plants mature, the cured product’s sweet, full-textured smoke may call to mind a whiskey-flavored pipe tobacco more than a fleshy tropical fruit. By any name, Papaya offers a complex flavor, along with considerable THC power.",
        "Papaya is a short gal with thin, delicate branches. She will slowly double in size from flowering induction to harvest, but tends to stay low, typically under 2 meters (6 feet). Flowers are quick to form and copious, with the slightly spongy buds often forming a “nipple” at their ends. Yields range between 300 and 400 grams per square meter in a soil-based sea of green (20 plants/m) under a 600-watt lamp. To bring out Papaya’s true palate, Nirvana recommends organically-fed cultivation. Although hydroponics cultivation may yield up to 25% more, the plants will not smell or taste anywhere near as lush as their soil-based sisters.",
        "Glazed eyes and couch-lock are almost certain to result from smoking this indica-heavy strain. Papaya is good weed for staying at home and getting absorbed into a favorite music selection or an interesting movie. It also is worth investigation for medicinal users seeking a pure and potent indica.",
