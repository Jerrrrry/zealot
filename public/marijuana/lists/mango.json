        "Mango’s parentage is part KC 33 and part Mango from a hippie fellow who grew it for 30 years, then let KC use it as a cross in 1991. This variety is a 100 percent indica strain that grows large and produces prodigiously.",
        "Don’t let Mango’s slow start fool you – this variety will eventually rival the impressive size of many KC varieties, which are especially intended for outdoor grows. If you want Mango to stay at an average size in an outdoor garden, allow only 3 weeks of vegetative time and transplant outdoors as late as July in Northern latitudes. Mango can also be grown in an indoor garden, but needs a lot of space. If you want some monster indoor plants, allow seedlings or clones to vegetate for 3-4 weeks before changing to a 12/12 light regimen. Mango gardeners must rule with an iron fist if they want to manage the size of this plant, and it is important to start the discipline early. Accomplish this by starting the vegetative phase about 1-2 weeks after the seedling has sprouted and proven vigorous. Once established, Mango plants will grow so fast, you can practically watch them change height in front of your eyes.",
        "Mango buds are massive and weighty, growing to lengths of 18 inches and the circumference of a woman’s calf. Luckily the branches give sturdy support. As it matures, this plant’s foliage can turn a very red to reddish purple color. The smell and taste are decidedly sweet mango and the stone is an even, mellow body sensation."
