        "Mikado is a fast producing indica, finishing as early as August in temperate outdoor latitudes and as soon as 6 weeks indoors with desirable yields. A title for the emperor of Japan, the name Mikado is composed of the Japanese words “mi” (honorable) and “kodo” (gate of the imperial palace). Other interpretations give this term the meanings “God of the Sun” and “open August gate” in Japanese.",
        "Federation developed this variety around 1993. Flavored like wild raspberries, this branchy variety develops purple leaves and calyxes during maturity. The buds are very fat and squat with distinctly pink hairs upon finish. Federation recommends growing Mikado indoors as a larger multi-branched plant, which suits the tendencies of this variety, leading to a better yield……… Sea of green is less than optimal for this indica, since it like to stay short and spread out. A terrific choice for outdoor growing, Mikado can yield a pound per plant and reduces work and worry with its early finish.",
        "The Mikado high is a mellow body stone that is good for an evening smoke, especially when enjoying casual activities such as watching movies or chilling out with your friends."
