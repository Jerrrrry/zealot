        "You can take the genetics out of California but you can’t take California out of the genetics. The guys from DNA are Southern California natives who migrated to realize their calling as breeders in the relative weed freedom of Amsterdam. But they didn’t leave all that great Cali genetics behind. California Grapefruit combines three of the Golden State’s favorite indicas: Northern Lights, Skunk #1 and Afghani.",
        "This plant autoflowers, with a short growing season of 7 1/2 to 9 weeks. A heavy yielder, she is a perfect choice for gardeners with space issues, Since she naturally forms one mega-cola and few side branches, California grapefruit almost volunteers for sea of green planting. Manicuring California grapefruit is a breeze. She tends to stay small, averaging 2 1/2 feet at maturity if vegetated for 2 weeks prior to flowering, but her big colas amount to at least one ounce of dried bud per plant, on average.",
        "California Grapefruit’s high creeps up, then settles in for hours. Her heritage of world-class indicas offers a classic “body high” that eases the mind and muscles like a long day lounging by the pool. Sleep often follows. This might be a good weed to relieve insomnia and tension. the smoke both smells and tastes a bit like a grapefruit plucked from a California orchard, a mixture of tart citrus, dirt and sun."
