        "Blue Skunk Special was born when connoisseur breeder Krystal crossed Northern Lights #5 with a huge dominating male plant, the Blueberry #1, then backcrossed with Holland Skunk Special. Under optimum conditions this heavily indica hybrid is a big mama with large calyxes and purple-blue hues.",
        "The “special” thing about Blue Skunk Special is that the skunk is in its name alone. The complex smell betrays no skunk heritage, instead giving off a berry aroma with a hint of spice and honeyed oil. Tasting of fruit and a dash of pepper, Blue Skunk Special’s buzz is very kicked back and smooth, a deep couch potato stone. While this variety tends to keep a medium height, she has a stocky build with copious branching and large fan-shaped leaves.",
        "Blue Skunk Special does especially well in an indoor professional environment or greenhouse. Once mistaken for an orange tree at first glance when growing in a greenhouse, the scent nevertheless makes it hard to miss her true identity. Hydroponic and soil setups are equally suitable. The tendency to branch makes it best suited as a large multiple branch plant, but Blue Skunk can be tamed to work in a sea of green method. This plant also fares well in the great outdoors, growing as tall as 6 feet (2 meters)."
