        "This strain comes from a seed bank formed by three Aussie growers with more than fifty years of cultivation experience between them. All of their strains carry a name with some connection to Australia; Bronze Whaler is named for a tropical whaler shark found off the southern coast. Often shortened to “Bronzie”, the shark’s anme comes from its recognizable bronze sheen. Bronze Whalers grow about 6-8 feet in length and often feed close to shore where they sometimes mistakenly attack swimmers.",
        "This indica-based namesake plant produces dense compact buds with an abundance of fine white pistils that change to a bronze hue on maturity. The leaves are serrated with a tapered angular shape not unlike a shark fin. When the buds ripen, the leaves lose vitality and change to yellow-brown.",
        "This F3 strain is a solid producer that reaches around 4 feet in height when flowered at 12 inches. It does well in a sea of green due to its columnar shape that allows for a good yield when the plant is trimmed to one main stem. MJOZ like to use a coco / perlite mix as medium.",
        "Bronze Whaler is an evening smoke, not well suite for daytime or work-time activities. The length of the high averages 3-4 hours with smokers often glued to the sofa for the duration. Bronze Whaler has medicinal potential for relieving pain and stress. The aroma and taste of this strain are strongly fruity with a distinct tropical overtone, a hint of its South Pacific origins. Bronze Whaler was awarded 2nd Place at the Sydney Cannabis Cup in 2002."
