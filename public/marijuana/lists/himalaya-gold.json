        "The Himalayan mountain range separates the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan plateau. it is home to the planet’s highest mountains, stretching across six countries with its dramatic contrasts of icy peaks and alluvial plains. This region, not far from the proposed origins of cannabis itself, is home to some fine landrace cannabis strains. The parents of the Green House Himalaya Gold originate in the Himalayan-bordering countries of Nepal and North India. These combined indica strains produce a fast growing plant with choco-smelling buds and a strong mellow high.",
        "Himalayan Gold is well adapted for indoor or outdoor environments and can be finished by the end of September in south Europe when started in March. This rapid grower is very branchy, so much so that untamed branches tend to compete with the main cola. The Himalayan Gold plant works best as a trained multi-branch plant or in a screen of green setup; sea of green limits its potential.",
        "Himalaya Gold’s buds are elongated cattails, with a tight structure of indica chunkiness. These plants can become impressively large and prodigious yielders. Indoor plants tend to finish at around 4-5 feet, but outside, they become giant bushes or small trees, getting as tall as 8 feet. The chocolate aromas of this plant carry over in the dark flavors of its buds, with sweet and spicy edges of coffee and a hint of pepper, wood, and floral sweetness.",
        "This all-indica treasure is a stoney pot that hits the legs before it reaches the head. It has the potential to be a lazy, couchlock, snackfest buzz. It may bring out or enhance your inner procrastinator, so better to smoke when putting off until tomorrow is truly an option. Take pleasure in the relaxing bodily effects. This is a fun strain for playing video games – the meditative, puzzle Tetris type, not the shoot ’em up variety. because of the easy growing characteristics, tempting aroma and flavor, and potent effect, this strain is great for medical users looking for pain relief, including those with MS or insomnia. Himalaya Gold can also really dial down the stress level."
