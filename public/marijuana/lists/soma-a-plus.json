        "Soma A+ may become the pet of the class. Short to medium in height, this mostly indica strain displays the bushy structure and colas so compact that it has been nicknamed “Rock Bud”. She is a good sea of green plant since height and branching are easy to manage. With an extended vegetation period, Soma A+ can be coaxed into a larger plant, and will perform inconspicuous in an outdoor garden.",
        "A fast bloomer, Soma A+ finishes in about 8 weeks and wards off spider mites so well, she is often the last holdout in the garden, keeping the pests at bay. The yield makes this bud more appealing to a connoisseur rather than a commercial grower, but the easy of growth and the quality of the final product will make this a coveted weed to share with your inner circle.",
        "At maturity, Soma A+ develops sugary red leaves reminiscent of autumn’s best maples. As the mostly indica genetics would lead you to expect, the buzz is relaxing to the body and mind, and good for contemplation or napping on rainy day afternoons. Better as a day ender than a day starter, Soma A+ provides medicinal quality cannabis with healing properties for what ails you, whether physical, psychological, or spiritual in nature.",
