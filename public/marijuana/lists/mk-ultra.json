        "Named for the notorious LSD brainwashing experiments conducted by the CIA and the Canadian police in the 1950s, MK-Ultra is secret American project pot, fathered by the Angels, the OG Kush. Appropriately, MK-Ultra is an unusual indica: its buzz is “bright”, body-stimulating and speedy, like the body wake-up of strong tobacco or coffee.",
        "MK-Ultra grows straight and narrow and likes to be topped. This strain stays green throughout her life. Her leaves start out fat, then get thin as they mature; her buds start off loose but get dense and hard with resin after about 40 day of flowering. MK-Ultra produces scores of small, round, popcorn-type buds. Both hydro and soil cultivation produce good yields. T.H. Seeds favors a sea of green method with 18-20 plants per square meter for this variety.",
        "MK-Ultra has a thick, lingering aroma and a fresh pine-tree flavor that surprises with a lingering tongue-fizz, like a carbonated soda or a fizzing candy. The immediate, jolting rush is hypnotic; the extreme flavor and smell make this strain bad for sneak-a-toke, but perfect for a party icebreaker. MK-Ultra’s stimulant stone can overcome body fatigue from a long night of dancing, but is a little too intense for focused work. MK-Ultra won 1st place in the 2003 High Times Cannabis Cup (Indica category)."
