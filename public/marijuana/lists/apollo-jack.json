        "No one could accuse Spain’s Queen Seeds of being unadventurous; for their Apollo Jack strain they’ve taken some of the very best contemporary genetics and bred them together to create some sort of monster. And by monster, of course, we mean a killer plant. For this strain they started off with a cross between the legendary Northern Lights #5 and Apollo G-13, a hydro-loving cross between Afghani and Thai plants, and bred this with a Jack Herer / White Widow cross of fantastic stature.",
        "With parental pressure like that, you might expect this strain to be nervous or rebellious, but in fact she grows with lots of confidence and style. After a few days of the 24/7 light cycle the seedlings will be growing well, and are keen to stretch into the light, so make sure your lamps aren’t too far away from the soil. This is definitely a lady who can look after herself, and neither pests nor disease can easily take her down – she’s got the immune system of a vegan ox and a stature to match. She’ll fill out in the flowering stage and by the end of the 60-day period you should be able to harvest about 600 grams per square yard of grow room.",
        "You’ll be stoked anyway after such a good harvest, but one little toke will send your serotonin levels sky-high (pardon the pun) and your body will instantly succumb to the wave of relaxation that you deserve after so much effort."
