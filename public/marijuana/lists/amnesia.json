        "You might not have heard of Hy-Pro, but you’ll definitely have heard of Amnesia: one of the most well known sativa dominant strains in recent history. Curiously, it wasn’t created by one of the big name breeders, but a guy at a nutrient company who had the magic touch. A blend of Neville’s Haze and Afghani genetics, Amnesia took the pot world by storm and continues to do so, with so many Amnesia crosses on the market that it’s impossible to keep track.",
        "Though Amnesia is an unfussy strain, it grows best in soil containers and doesn’t like to get too dry, so be careful to keep it moist at all times. Outdoors, these plants can easily reach 10 feet, so don’t plant them too early in the season if you want to tame them; planting later will limit their growing time in the vegetative stage.",
        "A breeder’s tip is to keep the plants fairly cool, and be very careful when applying nutrients. Flowering time is 12 weeks indoors, and bring sure to bring some friends around harvest time, as these buds are a hell of a job to trim!",
        "All your hard work will pay off as a few puffs on a pipe of Amnesia will have you soaring, exuberant and alive. A few more puffs, though, and you might not even remember where you put the stash. Did I leave it in the fridge? What’s your name again?"
