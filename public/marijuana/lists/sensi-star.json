        "Sensi Star is a great indoor plant, producing powerful, resinous, and very compact buds. Although mostly indica, she retains a complex high that affects the mind as well as the body. Introduced in 1995 by Paradise, this strain’s stability was improved in 1997 to deliver a strong plant with big fan leaves and nice thick buds.",
        "Sensi Star works well in a sea of green set-up with 20 plants per square meter potted close together. It is best to let them vegetate for 2 weeks before entering the 12/12 cycle. If the strong side branching is allowed to remain and flower, she needs a little extra space. Hydroponic and soil methods are equally suitable Prospects for gardening this plant outdoors are good in temperate zones, where she will reach approximately 6 feet and produce and average of 400 grams in a successful season.",
        "This headstrong indica produces rock hard colas that have a lemony scent and taste. Some smokers find the buzz to be a very strong body stone, while others report a high with more energetic, cerebral properties as well as a body sensation. THC levels have been reported at 20 percent for this variety, making it a one-hitter quitter. CBD has been measured at .9 percent.",
        "Sensi Star has earned her name, with prizewinning performances in the 1999 Highlife Cannabis Cup where she won first place in the bio indoor category. She claimed first prize in the same year at the High Times Cannabis Cup’s indica category."
