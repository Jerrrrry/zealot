        "Since it’s first introduction in the 1990s, AK cannabis genetics have been increasingly popular among both marijuana growers and users. Nirvana’s version of this plant, the AK-48, is known for it’s potency and an extremely quick finishing time. While it’ll usually be ready for harvest around 9 weeks, when grown in optimal conditions, this plant can finish in as little as 48 days.",
        "Although AK-48 is an indica dominant hybrid genetically, it has retained most of the a sativa qualities when it comes to smell, taste, and especially the high. These plants produce hard, dense buds that are covered in trichomes and have a very pungent aroma",
        "When it comes to growing AK-48, it is a very hardy plant which makes it a great choice for beginners. On the other hand, experienced growers can push this plant, making it ready for harvest in just under 7 weeks.",
        "Nirvana recommends planting 16 plants per square meter, then pruning each plant to only 6 branches and the top in order to optimize the size and bud consistency throughout the crop. She loves to be grown in soil, and does great in sea of green type gardens.",
        "AK-48 has a sweet, flowery, and somewhat earthy taste when smoked, and produces a happy, euphoric, sativa like high. Medical cannabis users have reported this strain to be very beneficial when dealing with stress or depression."
