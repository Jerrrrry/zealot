        "Skywalker is a cross of two award-winning indicas – Blueberry (1st prize HTCC 2000, 3rd prize HTCC 2001) and Mazar (2nd prize HTCC 1999, 2nd price High Life Cup 2002). The intention was to create one of the best Indica strains in the world. The special Blueberry taste and aroma are combined in this hybrid with the vigor and yield of Mazar.",
        "Blueberry characteristics such as “curling leaves”, slow initial growth, and bluish hues have disappeared in this hybrid, while taste, aroma (fruity and fresh), and the quality of the “high” are retained. Grown from clones at “Sea of Green”, these seeds will yield about 400 gr./m2 under optimum conditions."
